# Production implementation notes:
"""
For production deployment, this module would need:

1. Real AssemblyAI API integration:
   - File upload handling with retry logic
   - Proper error handling for API failures
   - Rate limit management (5 concurrent jobs max)

2. Audio file validation:
   - Format verification (WAV, MP3, etc.)
   - Duration limits and file size checks
   - Audio quality validation

3. Enhanced parallel processing:
   - Dynamic batch sizing based on API limits
   - Queue management for large numbers of clips
   - Progress tracking and status updates

4. Error recovery:
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Partial result handling for failed clips
   - Graceful degradation for API outages

5. Performance optimization:
   - Connection pooling for HTTP requests
   - Efficient memory usage for large files
   - Caching of completed transcriptions

6. Cost optimization:
   - Smart batching to minimize API calls
   - Audio preprocessing to reduce file sizes
   - Usage tracking and budget controls
