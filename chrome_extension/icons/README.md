# Extension Icons

You need to create the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a microphone or transcription theme
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG files as placeholders.

## Professional Icons

For production, consider:
- Hiring a designer
- Using icon generation services
- Creating SVG versions first, then converting to PNG
